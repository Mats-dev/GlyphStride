# GlyphStride

An offline-first, privacy-focused fitness app that puts you in control of your data.

## Core Philosophy

GlyphStride is designed for athletes who value privacy, simplicity, and ownership of their data. Unlike mainstream fitness platforms, GlyphStride is:

*   **Offline-First**: All your activity data is stored locally on your device in an SQLite database. No servers, no cloud, no accounts needed.
*   **Privacy-Focused**: Since your data never leaves your device (unless you choose to export it), your privacy is guaranteed.
*   **Minimalist & Usable**: A clean, intuitive interface that focuses on the essential metrics, getting out of your way so you can focus on your activity.
*   **Free & Open**: The app is free to use, with future development supported by optional donations.
